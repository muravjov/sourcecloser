 About sourcecloser
 
 sourcecloser is a Python utility to package non-packetized bunch of code
into a single .egg package. Its primary use is to:
- make a quick deploy easy: the result .egg is to be installed with easy_install
  with one command:
  $ <path-to-virtual-env>/bin/easy_install <name>.egg
- compiled code is being packaged only, not the source one (which is why 
  sourcecloser is called so); it is a decent means to close the code 
  from prying eyes (works better for Python3, but worse for Python 2.7 because of
  decompilers existance)

 Usage:
$ <path-to-virtual-env>/bin/python sc.py <source-code-directory> <package.egg>

 Features:
- version string is generated by running "git describe --tags"; so your code MUST
  be in a git repository and the command should not fail
- additional options may be listed in a special file named "sc.py.cfg" at the root
  of the package, see sample/sc.py.cfg
